# Introduction

Python docstrings are crucial for code readability and maintainability. Follow this structured guideline for consistent and informative documentation:

## Formatting
Use triple double quotes (`"""Docstring"""`).

## Sections
For complex functions or classes, include structured sections:

### Functions & Classes

For Python functions, include the following sections:

- **Purpose:**
- Briefly explain what the function or class does.
- Include motivation or context if it's not self-explanatory.

- **Parameters:**
  Clearly document parameters with their expected type, purpose, and any constraints.

- **Returns:**
  Explain what the function returns, including type and meaning.

- **Raises:**
  List any exceptions the function explicitly raises.

- **Examples:**
  Provide a short example demonstrating typical use.

### Scripts
For Python scrips, include the following sections:

- **Purpose:**
- Briefly explain what the script does.
- Include motivation or context if it's not self-explanatory.

- **Inputs:**
  Clearly document the input of the script and associated requirements and constraints.

- **Outputs:**
  Explain the outputs of the script, including the format and the content in it.
  
- **Example:**
  Provide an example showing how to excute the script in command line with exmaple inputs and outputs.

## Additional Tips
- Update docstrings alongside code changes.
- Use consistent formatting throughout the project.
