# Notebooks

A few Jupyter notebooks demonstrate how the lists are cleaned and how to explore the final dataset.

- `data_cleaning.ipynb` – example cleaning steps for one of the sources
- `explore.ipynb` – quick inspection of `news_domains.csv`

These notebooks are optional and not required to run the Snakemake pipeline.
