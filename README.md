# Project template

A simple template for research project repos.

The template contains the following directories:

1. `data` for raw & derived datasets
1. `libs` for libraries for the project
1. `notebooks` for (timestamped) experiment notebooks
1. `workflow` for workflow files and scripts
1. `.gitignore` for temporary and binary files to be ignored by git (LaTeX, Python, Jupyter, data files, etc.)

# Logistics

- **Project management**: We will use GitHub issues to track and assign tasks.
- **Committing new code**: Push to `main` branch is disabled. To commit new code, please create a new [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches), then create a new [Pull Request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests). Merging to `main` branch requires at least one reviewer signs it off.
